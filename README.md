# Programming Massively Parallel Hardware (PMPH), Block 1 2020

## Course Structure

PMPH is structured to have four hours of virtual lectures and four
hours of mixed (physical + virtual) labs per week; potentially we
will have no lectures in the last few weeks of the course, so you
can concentrate on project work (to be announced).

### Lectures (zoom links will be posted on Absalon):

* Tuesday  10:15 - 12:00
* Thursday 10:15 - 12:00

### Labs: 

* Thursday 13:00 - 17:00 (or later of students ask for it)

We have not been yet assigned classes, but the plan is that half of
the enrolled students (say according to alphabetical ordering) may
physically attend the lab from 13:00 - 15:00 and the other half
attends virtually on zoom, and then we switched roles for the
session between 15:00 - 17:00.

If like the idea of physically attend the labs, then I suggest you
come to DIKU for the other lab session as well 13:00 (the one in
which you are only allowed virtual presence by default), because
I would allow the other students to join until the corona class
capacity is reached by a first-come first-serve policy.
(This is because typically some students absentee the physical lab
session, so there might be space for the others). If we are out of
space you can find a quit place to attend by zoom via edurom.

### Evaluation

Throughout the course, you will hand in four weekly assignments,
which will count for 40\% of the final grade. In the last month
of the course, you will work on a group project (up to three
students per group), and will submit the report and accompanying
code. The group project will be presented orally at the exam together
with the answers to some individual questions, and this will count
for 60\% of your final grade.

PMPH is structured around five weeks with lectures and lab sessions
on Monday and Wednesday, followed by a final project to be
presented orally at the exam.  Throughout the course, you will hand in
four weekly assignments.  These *weeklies* count for 40\% of the
grade, while the exam counts for 60\%.

The teachers are **Cosmin Oancea** and **Troels Henriksen**.

All lectures and lab sessions will be delivered in English.  The
assignments and projects will be posted in English, and while you can
chose to hand in solutions in either English or Danish, English is
preferred.

All course material is distributed via this GitHub page.  Assignment
handin is still on Absalon.  There is no mandated textbook for the
course - you will be assigned reading material from papers and such.

## Course schedule

This course schedule is tentative and will be updated as we go along.

The lab sessions are aimed at providing help for the weeklies and
group project.  Do not assume you can solve them without showing up to
the lab sessions.

On Monday, we are in "Kursussal 3" at "Zoo" (a building connected to
the museum of zoology).

On Wednesday, we are at DIKU in classroom 1-0-22 from 10:00-12:00 and
in classrom 1-0-26 from 13:00-15:00.

**Note that the order of labs and lectures are swapped for the first
three teaching days.**

## Weekly assignments

The weekly assignments are **mandatory**, must be solved
**individually**, and make up 40% of your final grade.  Submission is
on Absalon.

You will receive feedback a week after the handin deadline (at the
latest).  You then have another week to prepare a resubmission.  That
is, **the resubmission deadline is two weeks after the original handin
deadline**.

## Group project

[Project suggestions here.](project-suggestions.md)

## Practical information

You may find it useful to make use of DIKUs GPU machines in your work.
You log in by first SSHing to the bastion server
`ssh-diku-apl.science.ku.dk` using your KU license plate (`abc123`) as
the user name, and then SSHing on to one of the GPU machines.  Despite
their names, they each have two multi-core CPUs and plenty of RAM as
well.

  * `gpu01-diku-apl`, `gpu02-diku-apl`, `gpu03-diku-apl` have dual GTX
    780 Ti GPUs.

  * `phi-diku-apl` has a K40 GPU.

  * `gpu04-diku-apl` has a GTX 2080 Ti GPU (by far the fastest).

All machines should have all the software installed you need.  If you
are missing something, [contact Troels](mailto:athas@sigkill.dk).  The
machines have a shared home directory (which is very slow), *except*
`gpu01-diku-apl`, which has its own home directory (which is a little
faster).

### GPU setup

For CUDA to work, you may need to add the following to your `$HOME/.bash_profile`:

```bash
CUDA_DIR=/usr/local/cuda
export PATH=$CUDA_DIR/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_DIR/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LIBRARY_PATH
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CUDA_DIR/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$CUDA_DIR/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
```
